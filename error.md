Hello, I'm Junwon. I'm a Korean high school junior student at Qingdao Daewon International School. I was raised in Korea, but now I live and study in Qingdao, China.

Previously, I enjoyed competitive programming, solving problems algorithmically with C/C++. I also founded a Competitive Programming Club and AI Hackathon in my high school. I organized events, developed a school online judge (wboj.app), and created algorithm problems.

I spent one summer as a software engineering intern at Smooth, where I developed a launch pad platform and a smart contract for the Sepolia test network.

Now, I'm currently focusing on machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and cloud computing. I'm thinking about how to process large data like images or videos with fewer resources for both clients and service providers.

When I'm not doing the above, I usually take photos, play the guitar, or work out at a gym.
